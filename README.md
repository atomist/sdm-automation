## Development

You will need to have [Node.js][node] installed.  To verify that the
right versions are installed, please run:

```
$ node -v 
v8.4.0
$ npm -v
5.4.1
```

[node]: https://nodejs.org/ (Node.js)

### Build and Test

Command | Reason
------- | ------
`npm install` | to install all the required packages
`npm run build` | lint, compile, and test
`npm start` | to start the Atomist automation client
`npm run autostart` | run the client, refreshing when files change
`npm run lint` | to run tslint against the TypeScript
`npm run compile` | to compile all TypeScript into JavaScript
`npm test` | to run tests and ensure everything is working
`npm run autotest` | run tests continuously
`npm run clean` | remove stray compiled JavaScript files and build directory

### Release

To create a new release of the project, update the version in
package.json and then push a tag for the version.  The version must be
of the form `M.N.P` where `M`, `N`, and `P` are integers that form the
next appropriate [semantic version][semver] for release.  The version
in the package.json must be the same as the tag.  For example:

[semver]: http://semver.org

```console
$ npm version 1.2.3
$ git tag -a -m 'The ABC release' 1.2.3
$ git push origin 1.2.3
```

The Travis CI build (see badge at the top of this page) will publish
the NPM module and automatically create a GitHub release using the tag
name for the release and the comment provided on the annotated tag as
the contents of the release notes.
